# Convolutional Neural Network

The aim of this assignment is to train and test a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
We have also implemented Batch Normalization,dropout, data augmentation, guided backpropagation, t-SNE visualization and fooling.

## Acknowledgments
* We have modified tensorflow's [NMT Model](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt) for experimenting with advanced concepts. The modified nmt code can be found in /code/nmt/ directory.
* We also used [Hvass-Labs](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials) as reference. It's awesome! Do check it out.
